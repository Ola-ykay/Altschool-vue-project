# altschool-vue-project
## Description
This project involves creating a Vue JS application that integrates with the GitHub API to fetch data about a user's repositories, and displaying them in an intuitive and visually appealing way. The application has pages, one to show a list of all repositories, another to display detailed information about a single repository and another to search for users or repositories. The application implemented pagination and a wildcard route to catch 404 pages.
